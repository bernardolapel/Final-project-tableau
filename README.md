# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
-Discover the trends in the dataset.
-Explain reasons for the high number of strike at state level or airports.

## Process
Step 1- Connect the data to Tableau.

Step 2- Detect and understand the different data types in the table.

Step 3- Build different visualizations to learn about the dataset.

Step 4- Identify the categorical features in the table. 
  - Effect- Amount of damage, impact of flight, indicated damaged.
  - When - Collision date and time, time of day and phase of flight
  - Wildlife – Animal category, species order, species group and species.


## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)
Option 2 - faa_data_subset
Findings include:
-Increase in the number of wildlife strikes over time.
-Birds are the dominant wildlife category with the most strikes.
-Most wildlife strikes have no impact or no damage.

Visualization
-Used map to show the states with the most strikes because it is a geographical dataset.
-Used line chart to see the trend and forecasted future strikes over date and time.
-Used Pie chart to show amount and kind of damages caused by wildlife strikes.
-Used Clustering to group cost of amount spend on repairs and time out of service caused by wildlife  strikes.
-Used Bar chart to show categorical features of the different wildlife categories, when wildlife strikes occurred and the effects they had on flights.

Problem question
-Will the cost of repair increase over time as the number of wildlife strikes increase?
A trend analysis shows that since most of the strikes had no effect or no damage, the cost spent on repairs did not increase in direct proportion to the increase in the number of strikes over the year.

-Will the out of service hours increase over time as the number of wildlife strike increase?
A trend analysis shows that since most of the strikes had no effect or no damage, the out of service time did not increase in direct proportion to the increase in the number of strikes over the year.
-Can we find out the major cause of high number of wildlife strikes at state level or airports?
The cause of the number of strikes at the state level or airport can be explained by the number of wildlife presence at the states or airport. Data shows that even the states with most airports and/or  busiest airports did not correspond directly to the high number of strikes recorded in the dataset.


## Challenges 
I would have liked to categorize the airports into international, private and commercial in order to understand the data better.

## Future Goals
Future goals will be to expand the analysis based on other related datasets such as customers experience or sentiments as a result of wildlife strikes.
